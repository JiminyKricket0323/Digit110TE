        <purpose why="reason">I wanted to write a journal to look back on myself with honesty. </purpose>
        <confession honesty="off-track">I've been very off track lately, especially academic wise
            and with my family.</confession>
        <confession honesty="diagnose">From getting diagnosed that there was an issue in my thyroid
            when I was back home during the summer break, it has started to affect my daily
            bases.</confession>
        <outcome daily-bases="symptoms">I found it hard to focus on one thing for a long, keeping a
            regular sleep routine, irregular periods, and getting colossal mood swings that I've
            never experienced before. Because of that, I've lost my motivation to study during
            class, constantly feeling tired and procrastinating most of my assignments.</outcome>
        <enlight realization="standard">Knowing that this kind of behavior isn't acceptable
            from my personal standard, I'm in the bad cycle of constantly stressing myself out from
            my unacceptable behavior that I have lost control of.</enlight>
        <confession honesty="anxious">I understand that life has ups and downs, but the down part
            caused by my health condition makes me so anxious than ever before especially while I'm
            in another country.</confession>
        <outcome daily-bases="alerts">After receiving alerts from a few of my professors that they
            were concerned about my attendance and assignments, I was afraid to tell them what I'm
            going through.</outcome>
        <confession honesty="desire">But deep inside me, I know that I still have a desire to
            perform well in college. I'm slowly making progress but at the same time I'm worried
            that I won't be able to submit my work.</confession>
