    <title>Gingersnaps </title>
    
    <description>These crunchy, spicy rounds with their cracked, sugary tops are equally at home
    dunked in tea, coffee, or milk, and frequently enjoyed during the November/December holiday
    season. But they're just as welcome on a mellow, golden, late-September afternoon, with a
    comfortable lounge chair and a large glass of fresh-squeezed lemonade. </description>

    </QnA>
    
    Coating 
    
    <ingred>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</ingred> 
    <ingred>1 teaspoon cinnamon </ingred>
    
    Instructions 
    
    <step>Preheat the oven to <temp>375Â°F</temp>. Lightly grease (or line with parchment)
        two baking sheets. </step>
    <step>Beat together the <ingred>shortening</ingred>, <ingred>sugar</ingred>, <ingred>salt</ingred>, and <ingred>baking soda</ingred>.</step>
    <step>Beat in the <ingred>egg</ingred>, then the <ingred>molasses</ingred>. </step>
    <step>Add the <ingred>flour</ingred> and <ingred>spices</ingred>, beating to make a smooth, fairly stiff dough.</step>
    <step>To make the coating, combine the <ingred>sugar</ingred> and <ingred>cinnamon</ingred>, and place in a shallow pan or
        dish.</step>
    <step>Drop the dough in 1" balls into the cinnamon-sugar mixture; a teaspoon cookie scoop is
        perfect here. </step>
    <step>Roll the balls in the sugar to coat, then transfer them to the prepared baking sheets,
        leaving at least 1 1/2" between them; they'll spread as they bake.</step>
    <step>Bake the cookies for 11 minutes, for cookies that are crisp around the edges, and "bendy"
        in the center. Bake for 13 minutes, for cookies that are crisp/crunchy all the way
        through.</step>
    <step>Remove the cookies from the oven, and cool right on the pan, or on a rack. Cool
        completely, then store tightly wrapped, at room temperature.</step>
