        <title>Gingersnaps </title>


        <description>These crunchy, spicy rounds with their cracked, sugary tops are equally at home
            dunked in tea, coffee, or milk, and frequently enjoyed during the November/December
            holiday season. But they're just as welcome on a mellow, golden, late-September
            afternoon, with a comfortable lounge chair and a large glass of fresh-squeezed lemonade. </description>

            <ingredtwo> 
                <ingred>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</ingred>
                <ingred>1 teaspoon cinnamon </ingred>

         <instrc> Instructions 
               
            <step n="1">Preheat the oven to <temp>375Â°F</temp>. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking
                sheets. </step>
            <step n="2">Beat together the <ingred>shortening</ingred>, <ingred>sugar</ingred>,
                    <ingred>salt</ingred>, and <ingred>baking soda</ingred>.</step>
            <step n="3">Beat in the <ingred>egg</ingred>, then the <ingred>molasses</ingred>. </step>
            <step n="4">Add the <ingred>flour</ingred> and <ingred>spices</ingred>, beating to make a
                    <texture>smooth</texture>, fairly stiff dough.</step>
            <step n="5">To make the coating, combine the <ingred>sugar</ingred> and
                    <ingred>cinnamon</ingred>, and place in a shallow pan or dish.</step>
            <step n="6">Drop the dough in 1" balls into the cinnamon-sugar mixture; <msrmt id="mixture">a
                    teaspoon</msrmt> cookie scoop is perfect here. </step>
            <step n="7">Roll the balls in the sugar to coat, then transfer them to the prepared baking
                sheets, leaving at least <msrmt id="placing">1 1/2"</msrmt> between them; they'll
                spread as they bake.</step>
            <step n="8">Bake the cookies for <duration>11 minutes</duration>, for cookies that are
                    <texture>crisp</texture> around the edges, and <texture>"bendy"</texture> in the
                center. Bake for <duration>13 minutes</duration>, for cookies that are
                    <texture>crisp/crunchy</texture> all the way through.</step>
            <step n="9">Remove the cookies from the oven, and cool right on the pan, or on a rack. Cool
                completely, then store tightly wrapped, at <temp>room temperature</temp>.</step>
